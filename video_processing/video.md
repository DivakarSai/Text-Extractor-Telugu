Video Processing: Extract frames from the videos and preprocess them for text extraction.

import cv2

# Open the video file
video_path = "/path/to/your/video.mp4"
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)

# Check if the video file was successfully opened
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Error opening video file")
    exit()

# Read frames from the video
while True:
    # Read the next frame
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Check if the frame was successfully read
    if not ret:
        break

    # Preprocess the frame for text extraction
    # Add your preprocessing code here

    # Display the frame
    cv2.imshow("Frame", frame)

    # Press 'q' to exit
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the video file and close the window
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
