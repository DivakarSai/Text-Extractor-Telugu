To build a tool that can extract text from running scrollings on a news channel in Telugu, you can break down the task into several subtasks:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of Telugu news channel videos with running scrollings.

Video Processing: Extract frames from the videos and preprocess them for text extraction.

Text Detection: Implement an algorithm to detect regions of interest (ROIs) where the scrolling text is present in each frame.

Text Extraction: Develop a method to extract the text from the detected ROIs accurately.
